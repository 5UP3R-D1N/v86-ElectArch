# ElectArch
Simple arch linux emulator using electron and v86

Still WIP, But quited indev

Basically this is my attempt making a better(i think) design of v86 website

Feature :
 - Autosave(It works this time)
 - Nice dark terminal design
 - File exchanging
 - Arch linux with latest tools
 - Network access(WIP)
 - Starts very fast(Accept first start after computer restart)
 - Light(This time not single file anymore, Can be reused easily)
